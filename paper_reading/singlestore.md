* Two industry trends for the new generation of databases.

* **Trend 1**: *Cloud-native architecture* designed to take advantage of *elastic cloud infrastructure*
    * *Cloud blob stores* and block storage allow *limitless*, highly *available and durable* storage.
    * Spike in throughput or complex query ==> use Elastic compute instances to bring more compute on-demand.


* **Trend 2**: *Demand from developers to **store more data** and access with **lower latency** and **higher throughput***
    * *Flexible data access* requirement
    * Common approach: using domain-specific database.
