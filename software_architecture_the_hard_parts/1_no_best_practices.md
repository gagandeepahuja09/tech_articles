* Virtually every problem presents novel challenges.
* The real job of an architect lies in their ability to objectively determine and assess the set of trade-offs on either side of a consequential decision to resolve it as well as possible.

* We don't talk about "best" because best implies that we were able to maximize all possible competing offers in the design. We instead talk about the "least worst".

*Why "The Hard Parts"?*
* Hard ==> Difficult
    * Facing problems that no one has faced before.
    * Decisions having long-term implications.
    * All this layered on top of the interpersonal and political environment where the decision is taken place.

* Hard ==> Solidity
    * Architecture ==> structural, Design ==> changes much more often.
