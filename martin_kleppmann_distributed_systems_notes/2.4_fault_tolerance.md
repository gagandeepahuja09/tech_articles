**Fault Tolerance**

**Availability**
* Service unavailability = downtime = loosing money.
* Five nines of availability = down 5.3 minutes / year.

* *Failure*: System as a whole isn't working.
* *Fault*: Some part of the system isn't working.

**Failure Detectors**
* *Failure Detector*: Algorithm that detects whether another node is faulty.
* A *perfect failure detector* labels a node as faulty if and only if it has crashed.
* A *typical implementation* of crash-stop/crash-recovery: send message, await response, label node as crashed if no reply within some *timeout*.
* *Problem*: Cannot tell the difference between crashed node, temporarily unresponsive nodes, lost message and delayed message.
* We can assume crashed node only if:
    * synchronous model (timing)
    * crash-stop (node behaviour)
    * reliable links.

**Failure Detector in Partially Sychnronous Systems**
* We might have both false positives and false negatives, but eventually we will label a node as failed only if it has actually failed. (Seems a bit weird to me).
