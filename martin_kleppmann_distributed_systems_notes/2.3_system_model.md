* 2 thought experiments:
    * Two generals problem: a model of networks
    * Byzantine generals problem: a model of node behaviour.
* In real systems, both network and node may be faulty.

* Capture assumptions in a system model consist of:
    * Network behaviour (eg. message loss)
    * Node behaviour (eg. crashes)
    * Timing behaviour (eg. latency)

**Networks are unreliable**
* Temporary overload of buffer.
* Human or nature intervention: unplugging the wrong network cable, natural damage.

**System Model: Network Behaviour**
* We assume bi-direction point-to-point communication with one of: 
    * *Reliable (perfect) links*:
        * Messages are always received if they are sent. They may be reodered.
    * *Fair-loss links*
        * Messages may be lost, duplicated or reordered.
        * If we keep retrying, a message eventually goes through.
    * *Arbitrary links (active adversary: eg. wifi owner)*
        * A malicious adversary may interfere with messages (eavesdrop, modify, drop, spoof, replay).
* It is possible to convert a lower guarantee link into a higher guarantee link.
    * We can convert fair-loss link into reliable links by retries and deduplication.
    * We can convert arbitrary link to fair-loss link by using a cryptographic protocol like TLS (Transport Layer Security: s (secured) in https).
        * Note: we can do anything if the adversary decides to block all the communication.
* *Network partition*: We have 2 or more subgroup which are able to communicate within themselves but not among each other.

**System Model: Node Behaviour**
* *Crash Stop (Fail-stop)*
    * A node may crash any moment and after crashing, it stops executing forever.
* *Crash Recovery (Fail-recovery)*
    * A node may crash any moment, loosing its in-memory state.
    * It may resume executing sometime later.
* *Byzantine (Fail-arbitrary)*
    * A node is faulty it is deviates from the algorithm.
    * Faulty nodes may do anything, including crashing or maliciour behaviour.

**System Model: Synchrony (Timing) Assumptions**
* *Synchronous*
    * Message latency no greater than a upper bound.
* *Partially Synchronous*
* *Asynchronous*
    * Message can be delayed arbitrarily.
    * Nodes can pause arbitrarily.
    * No timing guarantees.
