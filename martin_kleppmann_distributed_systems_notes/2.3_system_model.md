* 2 thought experiments:
    * Two generals problem: a model of networks
    * Byzantine generals problem: a model of node behaviour.
* In real systems, both network and node may be faulty.

* Capture assumptions in a system model consist of:
    * Network behaviour (eg. message loss)
    * Node behaviour (eg. crashes)
    * Timing behaviour (eg. latency)

**Networks are unreliable**
* Temporary overload of buffer.
* Human or nature intervention: unplugging the wrong network cable, natural damage.

**System Model: Network Behaviour**
* We assume bi-direction point-to-point communication with one of: 
    * *Reliable (perfect) links*:
        * Messages are always received if they are sent. They may be reodered.
    * *Fair-loss links*
        * Messages may be lost, duplicated or reordered.
        * If we keep retrying, a message eventually goes through.
    * *Arbitrary links (active adversary: eg. wifi owner)*
        * A malicious adversary may interfere with messages (eavesdrop, modify, drop, spoof, replay).
* It is possible to convert a lower guarantee link into a higher guarantee link.
    * We can convert fair-loss link into reliable links by retries and deduplication.
    * We can convert arbitrary link to fair-loss link by using a cryptographic protocol like TLS (Transport Layer Security: s (secured) in https).
        * Note: we can do anything if the adversary decides to block all the communication.
* *Network partition*: We have 2 or more subgroup which are able to communicate within themselves but not among each other.

**System Model: Node Behaviour**
* *Crash Stop (Fail-stop)*
    * A node may crash any moment and after crashing, it stops executing forever.
* *Crash Recovery (Fail-recovery)*
    * A node may crash any moment, loosing its in-memory state.
    * It may resume executing sometime later.
* *Byzantine (Fail-arbitrary)*
    * A node is faulty it is deviates from the algorithm.
    * Faulty nodes may do anything, including crashing or maliciour behaviour.

**System Model: Synchrony (Timing) Assumptions**
* *Synchronous*
    * Message latency no greater than a upper bound.
* *Partially Synchronous*
* *Asynchronous*
    * Message can be delayed arbitrarily.
    * Nodes can pause arbitrarily.
    * No timing guarantees.

**Violations of synchrony in Practice**
* Networks usually have quite predictable latency, which can increase because of: 
    * Message loss requiring retry.
    * Congestion/contention causing queuing.
    * Network/route reconfiguration.

* Node usually execute at a predicable speed, with occasional pauses like:
    * Context switches.
    * OS scheduling issues, eg. priority inversion. A thread can pause at any moment.
    * Stop the world garbage collection pauses. (can last for minutes if we have a large heap size).
    * Page faults, swap, thrashing. 
* Real-time operating systems (RTOS) provide scheduling guarantees, but most distributed systems do not use RTOS. They use general purpose OS.

* These choices are extremely crucial while designing a distributed algorithm. If our assumptions are wrong, all our bets are off. We have to be very sure that our assumptions for the synchrony model, the node behaviour and the network behaviour are correct.
* If we assumed crash-recovery nodes and some nodes turned out to byzantine, the algorithm won't work as expected. If we have byzantine nodes, we have to take them into account and change the algorithm accordingly.
* If we assumed a synchronous system and it became partially synchronous even for 10s, all of the guarantees of our distributed system are off and it won't work as expected.
