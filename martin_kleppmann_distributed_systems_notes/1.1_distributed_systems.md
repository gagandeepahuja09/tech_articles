* *Why make a distributed system?*
    * Some actions are *inherently distributed*. eg: sending a message from your mobile phone to your friend's mobile phone.
    * *Reliability*: The system as a whole keeps functioning even if one node fails.
    * *Better performance*: Get data from a nearby node rather than one halfway round the world.
    * *Solving bigger scalability problems*: Huge amounts of data can't fit in one machine.

* *Why not make a distributed system?*
    * Communication may fail (and we might not even know).
    * Processes may crash (and we might not event know).
    * All of this may happen nondeterministically.

* **Challenge in distributed system: Fault tolerance**: We want the system as a whole to continue working even when some parts are faulty. This is hard.
