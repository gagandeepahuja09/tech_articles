* Physical clock: Count number of seconds elapsed.
* Logical clock: Count number of events occurred.

* Physical timestamp are useful for many things but may not be consistent with causality.

* Two types of logical clocks:
    * Lamport clocks
    * Vector clocks

**Lamport Clock Algorithm**
`
    on initialisation do
        t := 0  // each node has its own local variable t
    end on

    on any even occurring at the local node do
        t := t + 1
    end on

    on request to send message m do
        t := t + 1; send (t, m) via the underlying network link
    end on

    on receiving (t', m) via the underlying network link do
        t := max(t, t') + 1
    end on

* If a -> b, then L(a) < L(b)
* If L(a) < L(b), then we cannot imply a -> b. a || b is also possible. We can just rule out b -> a.
* Possible that L(a) = L(b) for a != b
* Let N(e) be the node at which event e occurred, then the pair (L(e), N(e)) uniquely identifies an event e.

**Vector Clocks**
* Vector clock solves the following Lamport clock problem: if L(a) < L(b), we can't tell whether a -> b or a || b.
* Assume n nodes in the system.
* Vector timestamp of event a is V(a) = {t1, t2, ..., tn}
    * ti is the no. of events observed by node Ni.
* In case of Lamport clock, the timestamp for an event was a single counter. Here we maintain a separate counter for every node.
* On event at node Ni, increment vector element T[i].
