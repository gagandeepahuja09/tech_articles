**Clocks and Time in Distributed Systems**

* Distributed systems often need to measure time, eg:
    * Schedulers(eg. we need to measure time to do context switch) ,timeouts, failure detectors, retry timers.
    * Performance measurements, statistics, profiling.
    * Log files and databases: Record when an event occurred.
    * Data with time-limited validity (eg. cache entries).
    * *Determinig order of events across several nodes.*
* While running `dig www.google.com`, in the answer section we can see the ttl for a DNS entry.
* If we go to the security tab while inspecting, we can see the certificate also has a validity period.

* We distinguish two types of clocks: 
    * *Physical clocks*: Count number of seconds elapsed.
    * *Logical clocks*: Count events. eg. messages sent.

* *NB*: Clocks in digital electronics (oscillators) != Clocks in distributed systems (source of timestamps).

**Quartz Clocks**
* It is typically artifically grown silicon dioxide, cut to a certain shape and size.
* It then mechanically resonates at a certain frequency. The frequency can be tuned by cutting of the bits of lasers at.

* *Quartz clock error: drift*
    * Temperature significantly affects the drift. Room temp. is considered ideal for low clock drift.
    * Most computer clocks are correct within 50 ppm.
    * 1 ppm => 1 microsecond / second => 86ms / day => 32s / year.

**Atomic Clocks**
