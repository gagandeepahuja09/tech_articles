**Ordering of messages using timestamps**
* m2, the reply of message m1 is reached before m1 to user 3.
* If we check the diagram, t2 < t1 is still possible even in synced clocks if clock skew > network delay.
* *Timestamp order is inconsistent with expected order.*

**The happens-before relation (a -> b)**
* a happened before b iff, one of the 3 hold:
    1. a & b occurred at the same node, and a occurred before b in that node's local execution order.
    2. event a is the sending of some message m, and event b is the receipt of that same message m.
    3. there exists an event c such that a -> c and c -> b.
* If we are not able to draw any happens before conclusion, then a and b are concurrent (a || b).
* Concurrency here doesn't mean simultaneous, it means that the events did not know about each other.

* Happens-before example:
    * a -> b, c -> d, e -> f due to process order.
    * b -> c, d -> f due to messages.
    * a -> c, a -> d, a -> f, b -> d, b -> e, c -> f due to transitivity.
    * a || e, b || e, c || e, d || e.

**Causality**
* a -> b ==> a might have caused b ==> *Potential causality*
* a || b ==> a cannot have caused b
