**Latency and Bandwidth**
* *Latency*: Time until message arrives. Approx time taken for transfer of message.
    * Same building or datacenter: 1ms
    * One continent to another: 100ms
    * Hard drives in a van: 1day.

* *Bandwidth*: Data volume per unit time.
    * 3G cellular data: 1Mbit/s
    * Home broadband: 10Mbit/s
    * Hard drives in a van: 50 TB/box ==> 1Gbit/s

**Client-Server example**
* We used a tool called WireShark to check at the packets level rather than inspecting at a request level. We came to know that there is a limit to the amount of data that can be sent in a packet which is 1506 kB. 
    * HTTP uses TCP underneath and TCP breaks down the big message into small enough network packets so that the network can deliver them.
    * On the recipient side, TCP aggregates the network packets to get the result.
