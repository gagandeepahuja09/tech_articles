* RPC: A function on another node.
* Generally implemented using a framework which takes care of function call in a programming language as message passing over a network.
* Stub: It has the same type signature & looks the function that we want to call on the remote node. It sends it to the service (another node) that actually contains the implementation.
* RPC client translate the arguments received into a message format that can be sent over the network. This translation process is called marshalling or encoding.

* Ideally RPC makes a call to a remote function look the same as a local function call.
* In practice:
    * What if the service crashes during the function call?
    * What if a message is lost or delayed?
    * If something goes wrong, is it safe to retry?

**RPC in enterprise systems: microservices**
* Different services implemented in different languages.
* *Interoperability*: Datatype conversions.
* *IDL (Interface Definition Language)*: language independent API specification.
