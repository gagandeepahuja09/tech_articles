**Before**
* Dropwizard Java framework, RESTful and JSON-over-HTTP service endpoints.
* Shortcomings:
    1. Lacks clearly defined and strongly typed interface and data schema.
        * Often it is hard to tell what a service does and how to send requests and receive responses without examinig the source code.
        * Lack of service/client contract validation can cause incidents when contract-breaking changes are made.

    2. A RESTful service framework does not provide service RPCs.
        * Developers have to spend a non-trivial amount of time writing clients in multiple languages.
        * Good RCP code is much more than an HTTP client wrapper; if should include robust implementations of standard infra requirements and platform best practices - eg:
            * Passing request contexts.
            * Measuring requests and performance metrics.
            * Propagating service exceptions and causes.
            * Having monitoring and alerting for service endpoints.
            * Enabling mutual TLS.
        * All these require hours if not days of additional engineering work.

    3. JSON request/response data payloads are large and inefficient (eg. string, field names), compared to compact, schematized binary format especially for payload sizes at the 95th and 99th percentile.
