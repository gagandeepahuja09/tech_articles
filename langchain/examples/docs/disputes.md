A <a href="/docs/payments/disputes/" target="_blank">dispute</a> arises when your customer or the issuing bank questions the validity of a payment.

You can try out our APIs on the Razorpay Postman Public Workspace.

<a href="https://www.postman.com/razorpaydev/workspace/razorpay-public-workspace/folder/12492020-49fdb1f6-7e7d-426c-b7b4-3dd468d8565e" target="_blank">![Run in Postman](https://run.pstmn.io/button.svg)</a>

# Use Cases

- [Accept a dispute](#accept-a-dispute) against the payment.
- [Contest a dispute](#contest-a-dispute) with explanations and supporting documents to submit evidences.
- [Retrieve information about all disputes](#fetch-all-disputes).
- [Retrieve details for a specific dispute](#fetch-a-dispute) using the unique identifier linked to the dispute.

# Accept a Dispute

The following endpoint allows you to accept a dispute charge, indicating that you do not wish to contest the dispute, acknowledging it as `lost`. 

<url post>/disputes/:id/accept</url>

<callout warn>
**Watch Out!**

- The dispute status will change from `open` to `lost`.
- Accepting a dispute is **irreversible**.

## Path Parameter

`id` _mandatory_
: `string` The unique identifier of the dispute.

## Response Parameters
Descriptions for the response parameters are present in the [Dispute Entity](#dispute-entity) parameters table.

# Contest a Dispute

The following endpoint allows you to contest a dispute, indicating that you would like to challenge the dispute raised against a payment. 

<url patch>/disputes/:id/contest</url>

In addition to explicitly contesting a dispute, the contest process can also be triggered by:
- Attaching an evidence document using <a href="/docs/api/documents" target="_blank">Documents API</a> with having a purpose set to `dispute_evidence`.
- Providing the evidence in textual format.
- Specifying the contest amount (partial or full). The default choice is contesting the full amount if it is not specifically mentioned.

<callout>
**Handy Tips**

- Ensure you pass the `action` parameter as `submit` to confirm the contest of the dispute. Dispute evidence draft does not get auto-submitted.
- Ensure you provide a minimum of one document for contesting a dispute. Add as many relevant documents as possible to maximise the chances of dispute resolution in your favor.

: `string` The action to be taken for this contest. Possible values:

    - `submit`: Allows you to contest the dispute by updating the dispute entity and submitting the same to Razorpay. You need to provide a minimum of one document id (across any of the evidence object attributes) for a successful submission:
      - Submitting for review would change the status of your dispute from `open` to `under_review`. 
      - It triggers the webhook event `payment.dispute.under_review`.
