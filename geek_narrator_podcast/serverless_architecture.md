* Main advantages:
    * Pay as you go. Considering the number of requests. Eg: DynamoDB charged on the basis of no. of read and write requests.
    * Developers can focus on the core business logic rather than having to work on infrastructure. Hence can help improve developer productivity.
    * Some organizations also make use of the security features of the serverless as that is offloaded to AWS.

* Use-case dependent:
    * Startups might be fine with offshoring responsibility to other services such that I only need to write 10% of the code.
    * Remember: code is a liability.
    * On the other hand, in an enterprise, using this external service might bring compliance related issue, security audits, etc.
