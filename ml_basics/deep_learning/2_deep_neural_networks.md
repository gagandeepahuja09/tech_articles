**Deep Neural Networks**
* *Key idea: modularity*: Building a complex network from simpler functional units.
* A layer can be performing any kind of data transformation.
    * Through a deep stack of layers we can transform the input in more and more complex ways.
    * In a well-trained neural network, each layer is a transformation getting us a little bit closer to a solution.
