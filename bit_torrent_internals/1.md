* BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer protocol that makes distribution of large files:
    1. Easier
    2. Faster
    3. Efficient

**Classic Download And Need for BitTorrent**
* In client-server architecture, server's bandwidth is limited, so more clients will slow things down.
* Speed of data transfer is limited by the upload capacity of the server.
* If client has download speed of 100 mbps and server has upload speed of 60 mbps, we are limited by the min of the 2, that is the server upload speed in this case. Can we avoid this?

**Peer to Peer Networks**
* Each party has the same capabilities and can initiate conversations with each other.
* Key highlight of P2P: robustness. ==> No SPOF.
* P2P can be pure P2P or hybrid. 
* BitTorrent comes in 2nd category. It also uses a tracker for tracking metadata like which node should talk to what other nodes.

**Core Idea Of Bittorent**
* Download files from multiple machines concurrently.
    * Faster downloads.
    * Upload load is *distributed* b/w multiple peers.
    * *Better utilization* of download capacity.
    * Large number of downloaders would put *only a little extra load*.
    * Breaking files into *smaller chunks* would boost *concurrency*.

**Simplified Download Flow**
* User connects to the tracker which gives the peers having the chunks.
* All the chunks are then downloaded and concatenated locally.
